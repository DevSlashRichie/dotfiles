After installing your favorite OS in which this case will be Manjaro.
You'll forward into the console, so the first thing to be installed
will be that:

## Kitty - The fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal emulator

site: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

script: curl -L https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin

## NVIM 

After using sometime VI you'll find the pain it is to use, so then we install NVIM

site: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim

After installing NVIM you can install my styles to make it look better :)

## GITHUB

To setup github you'll need to create an ssh key & gpg key which I expect this to be 
done manually
